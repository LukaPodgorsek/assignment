# Home assignment - Tradeview Lite

Implement a simplified version of Bitstamp Tradeview (Frontend only). Feel free to use any content available on the internet. The nature of this example is entirely free form / unconstrained. Any question or request for additional clarification is welcome.
Upload your code to publicly available repository (e.g. GitHub).

## Requirements:

- Use public Bitstamp API - https://www.bitstamp.net/api/
- List available order pairs and give the user an option to select one.
- Display last price and order book for selected trading pair.
- Create buy/sell component for placing instant/market orders for a selected pair; API request can be mocked
  (recommended) Use websockets for real time price / orderbook updates: https://www.bitstamp.net/websocket/v2/
- (optional) Add any other component and/or functionality available on Tradeview
- (optional) Host your solution on freely available hosting service
- (optional) Add tests to validate the correctness of your code

Note: no need to fulfill every requirement. You can focus on a specific one and do that one very well.
